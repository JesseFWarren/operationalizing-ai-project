            "causes": "It's not clear what causes most angiosarcomas. Researchers have identified factors that may increase the risk of the disease. Angiosarcoma happens when cells in the lining of a blood vessel or lymph vessel develop changes in their DNA. A cell's DNA contains the instructions that tell the cell what to do. The changes, which doctors call mutations, tell the cells to multiply quickly. The changes cause the cells to keep living when healthy cells would die. The result is a buildup of cancer cells that can grow beyond the blood vessel or lymph vessel. The cancer cells can invade and destroy healthy body tissue. In time, cancer cells may break away and spread to other areas of the body.",

The spores can remain dormant for years until they find their way into a host. Common hosts for anthrax include wild or domestic livestock, such as sheep, cattle, horses and goats. Although rare in the United States, anthrax is still common throughout the developing world, in places such as Central America and South America, sub-Saharan Africa, Central Asia and southwestern Asia, southern Europe and Eastern Europe, and the Caribbean. Most human cases of anthrax occur as a result of exposure to infected animals or their meat or hides. In the United States, a few people have developed anthrax while making traditional African drums from the skins of infected animals. One of the few known instances of nonanimal transmission was a bioterrorism attack that occurred in the United States in 2001. Twenty-two people developed anthrax after being exposed to spores sent through the mail, and five of those infected died. More recently, in two separate outbreaks, heroin users in Europe contracted anthrax through injecting illegal drugs. A total of 40 people died. Heroin sold in Europe likely comes from areas where naturally occurring anthrax is more common.",

Urinary problems, such as difficulty starting urination, loss of bladder control, difficulty sensing a full bladder and inability to completely empty the bladder. Not being able to completely empty the bladder can lead to urinary tract infections. Sexual difficulties, including problems achieving or maintaining an erection (erectile dysfunction) or ejaculation problems. In women, problems include vaginal dryness, low libido and difficulty reaching orgasm. Difficulty digesting food, such as feeling full after a few bites of food, loss of appetite, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal bloating, nausea, vomiting, difficulty swallowing and heartburn. These problems are all due to changes in digestive function. Inability to recognize low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), because the warning signals, such as getting shaky, aren't there. Sweating problems, such as sweating too much or too little. These problems affect the ability to regulate body temperature.

Some infections can lead to bladder stones. Sometimes an underlying condition that affects the bladder's ability to hold, store or eliminate urine can result in bladder stone formation. Any foreign materials present in the bladder tend to cause bladder stones. The most common conditions that cause bladder stones include: Prostate gland enlargement. An enlarged prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH) can cause bladder stones in men. An enlarged prostate can obstruct the flow of urine, preventing the bladder from emptying completely. Damaged nerves. Normally, nerves carry messages from your brain to your bladder muscles, directing your bladder muscles to tighten or release. If these nerves are damaged \u2014 from a stroke, spinal cord injury or other health problem \u2014 your bladder may not empty completely. This is known as neurogenic bladder. Other possible causes of bladder stones include: Inflammation. Bladder inflammation, sometimes caused by urinary tract infections or radiation therapy to the pelvis, can lead to bladder stones. Medical devices. Bladder catheters \u2014 slender tubes inserted through the urethra to help urine drain from your bladder \u2014 may cause bladder stones. So can objects that accidentally migrate to your bladder, such as a contraceptive device or urinary stent. Mineral crystals, which later become stones, tend to form on the surfaces of these devices.

The most common ways that bacteria spread from animals to people are by: Eating raw dairy products. Brucella bacteria in the milk of infected animals can spread to humans in unpasteurized milk, ice cream, butter and cheeses. The bacteria can also be transmitted in raw or undercooked meat of infected animals. Inhaling contaminated air. Brucella bacteria spread easily in the air. Farmers, hunters, laboratory technicians and slaughterhouse workers can inhale the bacteria. Touching blood and body fluids of infected animals. Bacteria in the blood, semen or placenta of an infected animal can enter your bloodstream through a cut or other wound. Because normal contact with animals \u2014 touching, brushing or playing \u2014 doesn't cause infection, people rarely get brucellosis from their pets. Even so, people who have weakened immune systems should avoid handling dogs that are known to have the disease. Brucellosis normally doesn't spread from person to person, but in a few cases, women have passed the disease to their children during birth or through their breast milk. Rarely, brucellosis may spread through sexual activity or through contaminated blood or bone marrow transfusions.",

As a result, the heart doesn't pump enough blood to the rest of the body. An irregular rhythm that lasts for a short time can cause fainting. Sudden cardiac death can occur if the irregular heartbeat doesn't stop.

Periods of a fast heart rate could be a sign of carcinoid syndrome.",
            "causes": "Carcinoid syndrome is caused by a carcinoid tumor that secretes serotonin or other chemicals into your bloodstream. Carcinoid tumors occur most often in the gastrointestinal tract, including your stomach, small intestine, appendix, colon and rectum. Only a small percentage of carcinoid tumors secrete the chemicals that cause carcinoid syndrome. When these tumors do secrete the chemicals, the liver normally neutralizes the chemicals before they have a chance to travel through your body and cause symptoms. However, when an advanced tumor spreads (metastasizes) to the liver itself, it may secrete chemicals that aren't neutralized before reaching the bloodstream. Most people who experience carcinoid syndrome have an advanced cancer that has spread to the liver. Some carcinoid tumors don't have to be advanced to cause carcinoid syndrome. For instance, carcinoid lung tumors that secrete chemicals into the blood do so farther upstream from the liver, which then cannot process and eliminate the chemicals. Carcinoid tumors in the intestine, on the other hand, secrete the chemicals into blood that must first pass through the liver before reaching the rest of the body. The liver usually neutralizes the chemicals before they can affect the rest of the body. What causes carcinoid tumors is unclear.",

The parasite spreads from an insect known as the triatomine bug, also called the \"kissing bug.\" The parasite can infect these insects when they swallow blood from an animal that is infected with the parasite. Triatomine bugs live mainly in mud, thatch or adobe huts in Mexico, South America and Central America. They hide in crevices in the walls or roof during the day and come out at night. The bugs often feed on people while they sleep. Infected bugs poop, called defecate, after feeding. The stool leaves parasites on the skin. The parasites can then enter the body through the eyes, mouth, a cut or scratch, or the wound from the bug's bite. Scratching or rubbing the bite site, which often happens during sleep, helps the parasites enter the body. Once in the body, the parasites multiply and spread. Chagas disease doesn't spread from being near an infected person. But the infection can come from: Eating uncooked food that has feces from bugs infected with the parasite. Being born to a person who is infected with the parasite. Getting donor blood or an organ from someone who was infected with the parasite. Being exposed to the parasite while working in a lab. Spending time in an area where there are infected wild animals, such as raccoons and opossums.",

Most cases of cholera that cause symptoms cause mild or moderate diarrhea that's often hard to tell apart from diarrhea caused by other problems. Others develop more-serious signs and symptoms of cholera, usually within a few days of infection. Symptoms of cholera infection can include: Diarrhea. Cholera-related diarrhea comes on suddenly and can quickly cause dangerous fluid loss \u2014 as much as a quart (about 1 liter) an hour. Diarrhea due to cholera often has a pale, milky appearance that resembles water in which rice has been rinsed. Nausea and vomiting. Vomiting occurs especially in the early stages of cholera and can last for hours. Dehydration. Dehydration can develop within hours after cholera symptoms start and range from mild to severe. A loss of 10% or more of body weight indicates severe dehydration. Signs and symptoms of cholera dehydration include irritability, fatigue, sunken eyes, a dry mouth, extreme thirst, dry and shriveled skin that's slow to bounce back when pinched into a fold, little or no urinating, low blood pressure, and an irregular heartbeat. Dehydration can lead to a rapid loss of minerals in your blood that maintain the balance of fluids in your body. This is called an electrolyte imbalance.",
            "causes": "A bacterium called Vibrio cholerae causes cholera infection. The deadly effects of the disease are the result of a toxin the bacteria produces in the small intestine. The toxin causes the body to secrete enormous amounts of water, leading to diarrhea and a rapid loss of fluids and salts (electrolytes). Cholera bacteria might not cause illness in all people who are exposed to them, but they still pass the bacteria in their stool, which can contaminate food and water supplies. Contaminated water supplies are the main source of cholera infection. The bacterium can be found in: Surface or well water. Contaminated public wells are frequent sources of large-scale cholera outbreaks. People living in crowded conditions without adequate sanitation are especially at risk. Seafood. Eating raw or undercooked seafood, especially shellfish, that comes from certain places can expose you to cholera bacteria. Most recent cases of cholera in the United States have been traced to seafood from the Gulf of Mexico. Raw fruits and vegetables. Raw, unpeeled fruits and vegetables are a frequent source of cholera infection in areas where there's cholera. In developing countries, uncomposted manure fertilizers or irrigation water containing raw sewage can contaminate produce in the field. Grains. In regions where cholera is widespread, grains such as rice and millet that are contaminated after cooking and kept at room temperature for several hours can grow cholera bacteria.",

When you're active, however, the muscles aren't getting enough oxygen and nutrients to work well and remain healthy. Damage to peripheral arteries is usually caused by atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is the buildup of fats, cholesterol and other substances in and on the artery walls. This buildup is called plaque. The plaque can cause the arteries to narrow, blocking blood flow. The plaque can also burst, leading to a blood clot.",

Features of colic may include the following: Intense crying that may seem more like screaming or an expression of pain Crying for no apparent reason, unlike crying to express hunger or the need for a diaper change Extreme fussiness even after crying has diminished Predictable timing, with episodes often occurring in the evening Facial discoloring, such as skin flushing or blushing Body tension, such as pulled up or stiffened legs, stiffened arms, clenched fists, arched back, or tense abdomen Sometimes there is relief in symptoms after the infant passes gas or has a bowel movement. Gas is likely the result of swallowed air during prolonged crying.",

Your baby can be infected with a virus by: Air. When someone who is sick coughs, sneezes or talks, he or she might directly spread the virus to your baby. Direct contact. Someone with a cold who touches your baby's hand can spread the cold virus to your baby, who can become infected after touching his or her eyes, nose or mouth. Contaminated surfaces.

            "causes": "The cause of CRPS isn't completely understood. It's thought to be caused by an injury to or difference in the peripheral and central nervous systems. CRPS typically occurs as a result of a trauma or an injury. CRPS occurs in two types, with similar signs and symptoms, but different causes: Type 1. Also known as reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), this type occurs after an illness or injury that didn't directly damage the nerves in the affected limb. About 90% of people with CRPS have type 1. Type 2. Once referred to as causalgia, this type has symptoms similar to those of type 1. But type 2 CRPS occurs after a distinct nerve injury. Many cases of CRPS occur after a forceful trauma to an arm or a leg. This can include a crushing injury or a fracture. Other major and minor traumas \u2014 such as surgery, heart attacks, infections and even sprained ankles \u2014 also can lead to CRPS . It's not well understood why these injuries can trigger CRPS . Not everyone who has such an injury will go on to develop CRPS .

            "causes": "Constipation most commonly occurs when waste or stool moves too slowly through the digestive tract, causing the stool to become hard and dry. Many factors can contribute to constipation in children, including: Withholding. Your child may ignore the urge to have a bowel movement because he or she is afraid of the toilet or doesn't want to take a break from play. Some children withhold when they're away from home because they're uncomfortable using public toilets. Painful bowel movements caused by large, hard stools also may lead to withholding. If it hurts to poop, your child may try to avoid a repeat of the distressing experience. Toilet training issues. If you begin toilet training too soon, your child may rebel and hold in stool. If toilet training becomes a battle of wills, a voluntary decision to ignore the urge to poop can quickly become an involuntary habit that's tough to change. Changes in diet. Not enough fiber-rich fruits and vegetables or fluid in your child's diet may cause constipation. One of the more common times for children to become constipated is when they're switching from an all-liquid diet to one that includes solid foods. Changes in routine. Any changes in your child's routine \u2014 such as travel, hot weather or stress \u2014 can affect bowel function. Children are also more likely to experience constipation when they first start school outside of the home. Medications. Certain antidepressants and various other drugs can contribute to constipation. Cow's milk allergy. An allergy to cow's milk or consuming too many dairy products (cheese and cow's milk) sometimes leads to constipation. Family history. Children who have family members who have experienced constipation are more likely to develop constipation. This may be due to shared genetic or environmental factors. Medical conditions. Rarely, constipation in children indicates an anatomic malformation, a metabolic or digestive system problem, or another underlying condition.",

Early symptoms include: Personality changes. Memory loss. Impaired thinking. Blurry vision or blindness. Insomnia. Problems with coordination. Trouble speaking. Trouble swallowing. Sudden, jerky movements. Death usually occurs within a year. People with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease usually die of medical issues associated with the disease. They might include having trouble swallowing, falls, heart issues, lung failure, or pneumonia or other infections. In people with variant CJD , changes in mental abilities may be more apparent in the beginning of the disease. In many cases, dementia develops later in the illness. Symptoms of dementia include the loss of the ability to think, reason and remember. Variant CJD affects people at a younger age than CJD . Variant CJD appears to last 12 to 14 months. Another rare form of prion disease is called variably protease-sensitive prionopathy (VPSPr). It can mimic other forms of dementia. It causes changes in mental abilities and problems with speech and thinking. The course of the disease is longer than other prion diseases \u2014 about 24 months.",

You may notice this more when you have a cold or allergies that can cause your nasal passages to swell and narrow. Nosebleeds. The surface of your nasal septum may become dry, increasing your risk of nosebleeds. Facial pain. There is some debate about the possible nasal causes of facial pain. A possible cause of one-sided facial pain could be a severe deviated septum in which surfaces within the nose touch and cause pressure. Noisy breathing during sleep. A deviated septum or swelling of the tissues in your nose can be one of the many reasons for noisy breathing during sleep. Awareness of the nasal cycle. The nose alternates between being obstructed on one side and then changes to being obstructed on the other. This is called the nasal cycle. Being aware of the nasal cycle isn't typical and can indicate nasal obstruction. Preference for sleeping on a particular side.

A deviated septum can also be the result of an injury that causes the nasal septum to be moved out of position. In infants, such an injury may occur during childbirth. In children and adults, a wide array of accidents may lead to a nose injury and deviated septum. Trauma to the nose most commonly occurs during contact sports, rough play such as wrestling or automobile accidents. The aging process may affect nasal structures, worsening a deviated septum over time.

If your muscle cells become starved for energy, your body may start breaking down fat for energy. This process forms toxic acids known as ketones. If you have ketones (measured in blood or urine) and high blood sugar, the condition is called diabetic ketoacidosis. If it's not treated, it can lead to a diabetic coma. Diabetic ketoacidosis is most common in people who have type 1 diabetes. But it can also occur in people who have type 2 diabetes or gestational diabetes. Diabetic hyperosmolar syndrome. If your blood sugar level goes above 600 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), or 33.3 millimoles per liter (mmol/L), the condition is called diabetic hyperosmolar syndrome. When blood sugar is very high, the extra sugar passes from the blood into the urine. That triggers a process that draws a large amount of fluid from the body. If it isn't treated, this can lead to life-threatening dehydration and a diabetic coma. Hypoglycemia. Your brain needs sugar (glucose) to function. In severe cases, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) may cause you to pass out. Low blood sugar can be caused by too much insulin or not enough food.

            "causes": "Sugar is a main source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues. Insulin helps sugar enter the cells in the body. Without enough insulin, the body can't use sugar to make the energy it needs. This causes the release of hormones that break down fat for the body to use as fuel. This also produces acids known as ketones. Ketones build up in the blood and eventually spill over into the urine. Diabetic ketoacidosis usually happens after: An illness. An infection or other illness can cause the body to make higher levels of certain hormones, such as adrenaline or cortisol. These hormones work against the effects of insulin and sometimes cause diabetic ketoacidosis. Pneumonia and urinary tract infections are common illnesses that can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis. A problem with insulin therapy. Missed insulin treatments can leave too little insulin in the body. Not enough insulin therapy or an insulin pump that doesn't work right also can leave too little insulin in the body. Any of these problems can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis. Other things that can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis include: Physical or emotional trauma Heart attack or stroke Pancreatitis Pregnancy Alcohol or drug misuse, particularly cocaine Certain medicines, such as corticosteroids and some diuretics",

Tiny bulges protrude from the walls of the smaller vessels, sometimes leaking fluid and blood into the retina. Larger retinal vessels can begin to dilate and become irregular in diameter as well. NPDR can progress from mild to severe as more blood vessels become blocked. Sometimes retinal blood vessel damage leads to a buildup of fluid (edema) in the center portion (macula) of the retina. If macular edema decreases vision, treatment is required to prevent permanent vision loss. Advanced diabetic retinopathy. Diabetic retinopathy can progress to this more severe type, known as proliferative diabetic retinopathy. In this type, damaged blood vessels close off, causing the growth of new, abnormal blood vessels in the retina. These new blood vessels are fragile and can leak into the clear, jellylike substance that fills the center of your eye (vitreous). Eventually, scar tissue from the growth of new blood vessels can cause the retina to detach from the back of your eye. If the new blood vessels interfere with the normal flow of fluid out of the eye, pressure can build in the eyeball. This buildup can damage the nerve that carries images from your eye to your brain (optic nerve), resulting in glaucoma.",

            "causes": "Diaper rash may be caused by: Leaving on wet or soiled diapers too long. Skin can\u00a0develop a rash if wet or soiled diapers are left on too long. Babies may be more prone to diaper rash if they're having many stools or diarrhea. Chafing or rubbing. Tightfitting diapers or clothing that rubs against the skin can lead to a rash. Using a new product. Your baby's skin may react to a new brand of baby wipes, diapers or a detergent, bleach or fabric softener used to wash cloth diapers. Ingredients in lotions, powders and oils might add to the problem. Developing a bacterial or yeast infection. What begins as a simple infection may spread to the surrounding skin. The area covered by a diaper is at risk because it's warm and moist, making a perfect breeding ground for bacteria and yeast. These rashes can be found within the creases of the skin. Introducing new foods. As babies start to eat solid foods, the content of their stool changes. This increases the likelihood of diaper rash. Changes in your baby's diet can also increase the frequency of stools, which can lead to diaper rash. Breastfed babies might develop diaper rash in response to something the mother has eaten. Having sensitive skin. Babies with atopic dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis or other skin conditions may be more likely to develop diaper rash. The irritated skin of atopic dermatitis also tends to be in areas not covered by a diaper. Using antibiotics. Antibiotics can contribute to a rash by killing bacteria that keep yeast growth in check. Antibiotic use also increases the risk of diarrhea. Breastfed babies whose mothers take antibiotics also are at increased risk of diaper rash.",

            "causes": "An enlarged heart (cardiomegaly) can be caused by damage to the heart muscle or any condition that makes the heart pump harder than usual, including pregnancy. Sometimes the heart gets larger and becomes weak for unknown reasons. This condition is called idiopathic cardiomyopathy. Conditions associated with an enlarged heart include: Heart condition present at birth (congenital heart defect). Problems with the structure and function of the heart can cause the heart muscle to get larger and weak. Damage from a heart attack. Scarring and other structural heart damage can make it harder for the heart to pump enough blood to the body. The strain can lead to heart swelling and eventual heart failure. Diseases of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy). Cardiomyopathy often makes the heart rigid or thick. It can make it harder for the heart to pump blood. Fluid buildup in the sac around the heart (pericardial effusion). A collection of fluid in the sac that contains the heart can cause heart enlargement that can be seen on a chest X-ray. Heart valve disease. Four valves in the heart keep blood flowing in the right direction. Disease or damage to any of the valves may interrupt blood flow and cause the heart chambers to get larger. High blood pressure (hypertension). If you have high blood pressure, the heart may have to pump harder to deliver blood to the rest of the body. The strain can cause the heart muscle to grow larger and become weak. High blood pressure in the arteries in the lungs (pulmonary hypertension). The heart has to work harder to move blood between the lungs and the heart. The strain may lead to thickening or enlargement of the right side of the heart. Low red blood cell count (anemia). In anemia, there's a lack of healthy red blood cells to carry proper levels of oxygen to the body's tissues. The heart must pump more blood to make up for the lack of oxygen in the blood. Thyroid disorders. Both an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) and an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) can lead to heart problems, including an enlarged heart. Too much iron in the body (hemochromatosis). Iron can build up in various organs, including the heart. This can cause the lower left heart chamber to swell. Unusual protein deposits in the heart (cardiac amyloidosis). This rare disease causes a protein called amyloid to collect in the blood and get stuck in body organs, including the heart. Amyloid protein deposits in the heart cause an irreversible thickening of the heart wall. The heart has to work harder to fill with blood. Aerobic exercise. In some athletes, the heart becomes enlarged as a response to frequent and prolonged exercise. Usually, this type of enlarged heart isn't considered a disease and doesn't need treatment. Fat around the heart. Some people have extra fat around the heart that can appear on a chest X-ray. Unless there are other heart conditions associated, no treatment is necessary.",

Having too much amniotic fluid \u2014 the fluid that surrounds and protects a baby during pregnancy \u2014 might be a sign that your baby is larger than average.

A temperature taken using a mouth thermometer (oral temperature) that's 100 F (37.8 C) or higher is generally considered to be a fever. Depending on what's causing a fever, other fever signs and symptoms may include: Sweating Chills and shivering Headache Muscle aches Loss of appetite Irritability Dehydration General weakness",
            "causes": "Typical body temperature is a balance of heat production and heat loss. An area in the brain called the hypothalamus (hi-poe-THAL-uh-muhs) \u2014 also known as your body's \"thermostat\" \u2014 monitors this balance. Even when you're healthy, your body temperature varies slightly throughout the day. It can be lower in the morning and higher in the late afternoon and evening. When your immune system responds to disease, the hypothalamus can set your body temperature higher. This prompts complex processes that produce more heat and restrict heat loss. The shivering you might experience is one way the body produces heat. When you wrap up in a blanket because you feel chilled, you are helping your body retain heat. Fevers below 104 F (40 C) associated with common viral infections, such as the flu, may help the immune system fight disease and are generally not harmful. Fever or elevated body temperature might be caused by: A viral infection A bacterial infection Heat exhaustion Certain inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis \u2014 inflammation of the lining of your joints (synovium) A cancerous (malignant) tumor Some medications, such as antibiotics and drugs used to treat high blood pressure or seizures Some immunizations, such as the diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis (DTaP), pneumococcal or COVID vaccine",

To be considered widespread, the pain must occur on both sides of your body and above and below your waist. Fatigue. People with fibromyalgia often awaken tired, even though they report sleeping for long periods of time. Sleep is often disrupted by pain, and many patients with fibromyalgia have other sleep disorders, such as restless legs syndrome and sleep apnea. Cognitive difficulties. A symptom commonly referred to as \"fibro fog\" impairs the ability to focus, pay attention and concentrate on mental tasks. Fibromyalgia often co-exists with other conditions, such as: Irritable bowel syndrome Chronic fatigue syndrome Migraine and other types of headaches Interstitial cystitis or painful bladder syndrome Temporomandibular joint disorders Anxiety Depression Postural tachycardia syndrome",
            "causes": "Many researchers believe that repeated nerve stimulation causes the brain and spinal cord of people with fibromyalgia to change. This change involves an abnormal increase in levels of certain chemicals in the brain that signal pain. In addition, the brain's pain receptors seem to develop a sort of memory of the pain and become sensitized, meaning they can overreact to painful and nonpainful signals. There are likely many factors that lead to these changes, including: Genetics. Because fibromyalgia tends to run in families, there may be certain genetic mutations that may make you more susceptible to developing the disorder. Infections. Some illnesses appear to trigger or aggravate fibromyalgia. Physical or emotional events. Fibromyalgia can sometimes be triggered by a physical event, such as a car accident. Prolonged psychological stress may also trigger the condition.",

            "causes": "Coronary artery disease causes most heart attacks. In coronary artery disease, one or more of the heart (coronary) arteries are blocked. This is usually due to cholesterol-containing deposits called plaques. Plaques can narrow the arteries, reducing blood flow to the heart. If a plaque breaks open, it can cause a blood clot in the heart. A heart attack may be caused by a complete or partial blockage of a heart (coronary) artery. One way to classify heart attacks is whether an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) shows some specific changes (ST elevation) that require emergency invasive treatment. Your health care provider may use electrocardiogram (ECG) results to describe these types of heart attacks. An acute complete blockage of a medium or large heart artery usually means you've had an ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). A partial blockage often means you've had a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). However, some people with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) have a total blockage. Not all heart attacks are caused by blocked arteries. Other causes include: Coronary artery spasm. This is a severe squeezing of a blood vessel that's not blocked. The artery generally has cholesterol plaques or there is early hardening of the vessel due to smoking or other risk factors. Other names for coronary artery spasms are Prinzmetal's angina, vasospastic angina or variant angina. Certain infections. COVID-19 and other viral infections may cause damage to the heart muscle.

People with Henoch-Schonlein purpura often have pain and swelling around the joints \u2014 mainly in the knees and ankles. Joint pain sometimes precedes the classical rash by one or two weeks. These symptoms subside when the disease clears and leave no lasting damage. Digestive tract symptoms. Many children with Henoch-Schonlein purpura develop belly pain, nausea, vomiting and bloody stools. These symptoms sometimes occur before the rash appears. Kidney involvement. Henoch-Schonlein purpura can also affect the kidneys. In most cases, this shows up as protein or blood in the urine, which you may not even know is there unless you have a urine test done.

            "causes": "During digestion, the body breaks down carbohydrates from foods \u2014 such as bread, rice and pasta \u2014 into sugar molecules. One of the sugar molecules is called glucose. It's one of the body's main energy sources. Glucose is absorbed and goes directly into your bloodstream after you eat, but it can't enter the cells of most of the body's tissues without the help of insulin. Insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas. When the glucose level in the blood rises, the pancreas releases insulin. The insulin unlocks the cells so that glucose can enter. This provides the fuel the cells need to work properly. Extra glucose is stored in the liver and muscles. This process lowers the amount of glucose in the bloodstream and prevents it from reaching dangerously high levels. As the blood sugar level returns to normal, so does the amount of insulin the pancreas makes. Diabetes drastically reduces insulin's effects on the body. This may be because your pancreas is unable to produce insulin, as in type 1 diabetes. Or it may be because your body is resistant to the effects of insulin, or it doesn't make enough insulin to keep a normal glucose level, as in type 2 diabetes. In people who have diabetes, glucose tends to build up in the bloodstream. This condition is called hyperglycemia. It may reach dangerously high levels if it is not treated properly. Insulin and other drugs are used to lower blood sugar levels.",

            "symptoms": "Primary hyperparathyroidism is often diagnosed before signs or symptoms of the disorder occur. This is usually because an elevated level of calcium is found on routine blood tests. When symptoms do occur, they're the result of damage or dysfunction in other organs or tissues. This damage or dysfunction is due to high calcium levels in the blood and urine or too little calcium in bones. Symptoms may be so mild and nonspecific that they don't seem related to parathyroid function, or they may be severe. The range of signs and symptoms include: Weak bones that break easily (osteoporosis) Kidney stones Excessive urination Stomach (abdominal) pain Tiring easily or weakness Depression or forgetfulness Bone and joint pain Frequent complaints of illness with no clear cause Nausea, vomiting or loss of appetite",
            "causes": "Hyperparathyroidism is caused by factors that increase the production of parathyroid hormone. The parathyroid glands keep proper levels of both calcium and phosphorus in your body by turning the release of parathyroid hormone off or on. This is similar to how a thermostat controls a heating system to maintain a constant air temperature. Vitamin D also is involved in controlling the amount of calcium in your blood. Normally, this balancing act works well. When calcium levels in your blood fall too low, your parathyroid glands release enough parathyroid hormone to restore the balance. This hormone raises calcium levels by releasing calcium from your bones, increasing the amount of calcium absorbed from your small intestine and decreasing the amount of calcium lost in urine. When blood-calcium levels are too high, the parathyroid glands produce less parathyroid hormone. Calcium is best known for its role in keeping your teeth and bones healthy. But calcium also aids in the transmission of signals in nerve cells. And it's involved in muscle contraction. Phosphorus, another mineral, works along with calcium in these areas. Sometimes one or more of the parathyroid glands produce high amounts of parathyroid hormone. These high hormone levels can be the body responding appropriately to keep the calcium in the standard range, or they may be inappropriately elevating the calcium in the blood. Which one depends on the underlying problem. Hyperparathyroidism may occur because of primary hyperparathyroidism or secondary hyperparathyroidism.",

            "causes": "Hypoparathyroidism occurs when the parathyroid glands don't produce enough parathyroid hormone. There are four small parathyroid glands in the neck behind the thyroid gland. Parathyroid hormone controls the levels of calcium and phosphorus, so too little parathyroid hormone causes abnormal levels of: Calcium. This mineral is stored in bones and teeth and makes them hard. Calcium is also needed for muscle function, to help the nerves and brain work properly, and to control heart rhythm and blood pressure. Phosphorus. This mineral is found in all cells, but mostly in the bones. Phosphorus is needed to help the body create energy from food. Phosphorus also helps the muscles, nerves, heart and kidneys function. Causes of hypoparathyroidism can include: Neck surgery. This is the most common cause of hypoparathyroidism. It develops after accidental damage to or removal of the parathyroid glands during surgery. Neck surgery may be done to treat conditions of the thyroid gland, or to treat throat or neck cancer. Autoimmune disease. In some cases, the immune system attacks parathyroid tissues as if they were foreign bodies. In the process, the parathyroid glands stop producing their hormone. Hereditary hypoparathyroidism. This form can result from either being born without parathyroid glands or with glands that don't work properly. Some types of hereditary hypoparathyroidism are associated with deficiencies of other hormone-producing glands. Low levels of magnesium in the blood. Low magnesium levels can affect the function of the parathyroid glands. Normal magnesium levels are required for normal production of parathyroid hormone. Extensive cancer radiation treatment of the face or neck. Radiation can result in destruction of the parathyroid glands. In rare cases, radioactive iodine treatment for hyperthyroidism may lead to hypoparathyroidism.",

Iron deficiency anemia signs and symptoms may include: Extreme fatigue Weakness Pale skin Chest pain, fast heartbeat or shortness of breath Headache, dizziness or lightheadedness Cold hands and feet Inflammation or soreness of your tongue Brittle nails Unusual cravings for non-nutritive substances, such as ice, dirt or starch Poor appetite, especially in infants and children with iron deficiency anemia",
            "causes": "Iron deficiency anemia occurs when your body doesn't have enough iron to produce hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the part of red blood cells that gives blood its red color and enables the red blood cells to carry oxygenated blood throughout your body. If you aren't consuming enough iron, or if you're losing too much iron, your body can't produce enough hemoglobin, and iron deficiency anemia will eventually develop. Causes of iron deficiency anemia include: Blood loss. Blood contains iron within red blood cells. So if you lose blood, you lose some iron. Women with heavy periods are at risk of iron deficiency anemia because they lose blood during menstruation. Slow, chronic blood loss within the body \u2014 such as from a peptic ulcer, a hiatal hernia, a colon polyp or colorectal cancer \u2014 can cause iron deficiency anemia. Gastrointestinal bleeding can result from regular use of some over-the-counter pain relievers, especially aspirin. A lack of iron in your diet. Your body regularly gets iron from the foods you eat. If you consume too little iron, over time your body can become iron deficient. Examples of iron-rich foods include meat, eggs, leafy green vegetables and iron-fortified foods. For proper growth and development, infants and children need iron from their diets, too. An inability to absorb iron. Iron from food is absorbed into your bloodstream in your small intestine. An intestinal disorder, such as celiac disease, which affects your intestine's ability to absorb nutrients from digested food, can lead to iron deficiency anemia. If part of your small intestine has been bypassed or removed surgically, that may affect your ability to absorb iron and other nutrients. Pregnancy. Without iron supplementation, iron deficiency anemia occurs in many pregnant women because their iron stores need to serve their own increased blood volume as well as be a source of hemoglobin for the growing fetus.",

            "causes": "Lazy eye develops because of abnormal visual experience early in life that changes the nerve pathways between a thin layer of tissue (retina) at the back of the eye and the brain. The weaker eye receives fewer visual signals. Eventually, the eyes' ability to work together decreases, and the brain suppresses or ignores input from the weaker eye. Anything that blurs a child's vision or causes the eyes to cross or turn out can result in lazy eye. Common causes of the condition include: Muscle imbalance (strabismus amblyopia). The most common cause of lazy eye is an imbalance in the muscles that position the eyes. This imbalance can cause the eyes to cross in or turn out, and prevents them from working together. Difference in sharpness of vision between the eyes (refractive amblyopia). A significant difference between the prescriptions in each eye \u2014 often due to farsightedness but sometimes to nearsightedness or an uneven surface curve of the eye (astigmatism) \u2014 can result in lazy eye. Glasses or contact lenses are typically used to correct these refractive problems. In some children lazy eye is caused by a combination of strabismus and refractive problems. Deprivation. A problem with one eye \u2014 such as a cloudy area in the lens (cataract) \u2014 can prohibit clear vision in that eye.

Most people with lupus have mild disease characterized by episodes \u2014 called flares \u2014 when signs and symptoms get worse for a while, then improve or even disappear completely for a time. The signs and symptoms of lupus that you experience will depend on which body systems are affected by the disease. The most common signs and symptoms include: Fatigue Fever Joint pain, stiffness and swelling Butterfly-shaped rash on the face that covers the cheeks and bridge of the nose or rashes elsewhere on the body Skin lesions that appear or worsen with sun exposure Fingers and toes that turn white or blue when exposed to cold or during stressful periods Shortness of breath Chest pain Dry eyes Headaches, confusion and memory loss",
            "causes": "As an autoimmune disease, lupus occurs when your immune system attacks healthy tissue in your body. It's likely that lupus results from a combination of your genetics and your environment. It appears that people with an inherited predisposition for lupus may develop the disease when they come into contact with something in the environment that can trigger lupus. The cause of lupus in most cases, however, is unknown. Some potential triggers include: Sunlight. Exposure to the sun may bring on lupus skin lesions or trigger an internal response in susceptible people. Infections. Having an infection can initiate lupus or cause a relapse in some people. Medications. Lupus can be triggered by certain types of blood pressure medications, anti-seizure medications and antibiotics. People who have drug-induced lupus usually get better when they stop taking the medication. Rarely, symptoms may persist even after the drug is stopped.",

Experts don't know exactly what causes mammary duct ectasia. Some speculate the cause to be associated with: Breast tissue changes due to aging. As you age, the composition of your breast tissue changes from mostly glandular to mostly fatty in a process called involution. These normal breast changes can sometimes lead to a blocked milk duct and the inflammation associated with mammary duct ectasia. Smoking. Cigarette smoking may be associated with widening of milk ducts, which can lead to inflammation and, possibly, mammary duct ectasia. Nipple inversion. A newly inverted nipple may obstruct milk ducts, causing inflammation and infection. A nipple that's newly inverted could also be a sign of a more serious underlying condition, such as cancer.",

Nonspecific signs and symptoms. Measles typically begins with a mild to moderate fever, often with a persistent cough, a runny nose, inflamed eyes (conjunctivitis) and a sore throat. This relatively mild illness may last 2 to 3 days. Acute illness and rash. The rash is made up of small red spots, some of which are slightly raised. Spots and bumps in tight clusters give the skin a splotchy red appearance. The face breaks out first. Over the next few days, the rash spreads down the arms, chest and back, then over the thighs, lower legs and feet. At the same time, the fever rises sharply, often as high as 104 to 105.8 F (40 to 41 C). Recovery. The measles rash may last about seven days. The rash gradually fades first from the face and last from the thighs and feet.

The infectious droplets may also land on a surface, where they can live and spread for several hours. You can get the measles virus by putting your fingers in your mouth or nose or rubbing your eyes after touching the infected surface. Measles is highly contagious from about four days before to four days after the rash appears.

Distance runners are at risk of metatarsalgia, primarily because the front of the foot absorbs significant force when a person runs. But anyone who participates in a high-impact sport is at risk, especially if your shoes fit poorly or are worn. Certain foot shapes. A high arch can put extra pressure on the metatarsals. So can having a second toe that's longer than the big toe, which causes more weight than normal to be shifted to the second metatarsal head. Foot deformities. Wearing too-small shoes or high heels can cause your foot to be misshapen. A downward-curling toe (hammertoe) and swollen, painful bumps at the base of your big toes (bunions) can cause metatarsalgia. Excess weight. Because most of your body weight transfers to your forefoot when you move, extra pounds mean more pressure on your metatarsals. Losing weight might reduce or eliminate symptoms. Poorly fitting shoes. High heels, which transfer extra weight to the front of your foot, are a common cause of metatarsalgia in women. Shoes with a narrow toe box or athletic shoes that lack support and padding also can contribute to the problem. Stress fractures. Small breaks in the metatarsals or toe bones can be painful and change the way you put weight on your foot. Morton's neuroma. This noncancerous growth of fibrous tissue around a nerve usually occurs between the third and fourth metatarsal heads. It causes symptoms that are similar to metatarsalgia and can also contribute to metatarsal stress.",

            "disease": "Microcephaly",
            "symptoms": "The primary symptom of microcephaly is having a head size that is much smaller than that of other children of the same age and sex. Head size is a measure of the distance around the top of the child's head (circumference). Using standardized growth charts, health care providers compare the measurement with other children's measurements in percentiles. Some children just have small heads, with a measurement that falls below an established value for children of the same age and sex. In children with microcephaly, head size measures much smaller than average for the child's age and sex. A child with more-severe microcephaly may also have a sloping forehead.",
            "causes": "Microcephaly usually is the result of a problem with brain development, which can occur in the womb (congenital) or during infancy. Microcephaly may be genetic. Other causes may include: Craniosynostosis (kray-nee-o-sin-os-TOE-sis). Early fusing of the joints (sutures) between the bony plates that form an infant's skull keeps the brain from growing. Treating craniosynostosis usually means an infant needs surgery to separate the fused bones. This surgery relieves pressure on the brain, giving it enough space to grow and develop. Genetic changes. Down syndrome and other conditions may result in microcephaly. Decreased oxygen to the fetal brain (cerebral anoxia). Certain complications of pregnancy or delivery can impair oxygen delivery to a baby's brain. Infections passed to the fetus during pregnancy. These include toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus, German measles (rubella), chickenpox (varicella) and Zika virus. Exposure to drugs, alcohol or certain toxic chemicals in the womb. Any of these may affect fetal brain development during pregnancy. Severe malnutrition. Not getting enough nutrients during pregnancy may hurt fetal brain development. Uncontrolled phenylketonuria (fen-ul-kee-toe-NU-ree-uh), also known as PKU, in the mother. phenylketonuria (PKU) hampers the mother's ability to break down the amino acid phenylalanine and may affect brain development of the fetus during pregnancy.",

            "causes": "There is evidence that the migraine aura is due to an electrical or chemical wave that moves across the brain. The part of the brain where the electrical or chemical wave spreads determines the type of symptoms you might experience. This electrical or chemical wave can occur in areas that process sensory signals, speech centers or centers that control movement. The most common type of aura is visual aura, which occurs when a wave of electrical activity spreads through the visual cortex and causes visual symptoms. The electrical and chemical waves can occur with normal functioning of the nerves and do not cause harm to the brain. Many of the same factors that trigger migraine can also trigger migraine with aura, including stress, bright lights, some foods and medications, too much or too little sleep, and menstruation.",

The next time you come in contact with these proteins, immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies recognize them and signal your immune system to release histamine and other chemicals, causing a range of allergic signs and symptoms. There are two main proteins in cow's milk that can cause an allergic reaction: Casein, found in the solid part (curd) of milk that curdles Whey, found in the liquid part of milk that remains after milk curdles You or your child may be allergic to only one milk protein or to both.

            "causes": "To understand the causes of mitral valve disease, it may be helpful to know how the heart works. The mitral valve is one of four valves in the heart that keep blood flowing in the right direction. Each valve has flaps (leaflets) that open and close once during each heartbeat. If a valve doesn't open or close properly, blood flow through the heart to the body can be reduced. In mitral valve prolapse, one or both of the mitral valve leaflets have extra tissue or stretch more than usual. The leaflets can bulge backward (prolapse) like a parachute into the left upper heart chamber (left atrium) each time the heart contracts to pump blood. The bulging may keep the valve from closing tightly. If blood leaks backward through the valve, the condition is called mitral valve regurgitation.",

Nonallergic rhinitis can happen when you eat. Hot or spicy foods are the main triggers. Drinking alcohol also can cause the tissue that lines the inside of the nose to swell. This can lead to a stuffy nose. Some medicines. These include aspirin and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others). High blood pressure medicines such as beta blockers also can cause symptoms. Medicines that have a calming effect, called sedatives, can trigger nonallergic rhinitis too. So can medicines for depression. Birth control pills and medicines that treat erectile dysfunction also can trigger the symptoms. And using decongestant nose spray or drops too often can cause a type of nonallergic rhinitis called rhinitis medicamentosa. Hormone changes. These can be due to pregnancy, periods or birth control use. Hormone problems that may trigger nonallergic rhinitis include a condition that happens when the thyroid gland doesn't make enough thyroid hormone. This is called hypothyroidism.

Sometimes the pain feels like a dull ache behind the eye. Vision loss in one eye. Most people have at least some temporary reduction in vision, but the extent of loss varies. Noticeable vision loss usually develops over hours or days and improves over several weeks to months. Vision loss is permanent in some people. Visual field loss. Side vision loss can occur in any pattern, such as central vision loss or peripheral vision loss. Loss of color vision. Optic neuritis often affects color perception. You might notice that colors appear less vivid than normal. Flashing lights. Some people with optic neuritis report seeing flashing or flickering lights with eye movements.",
            "causes": "The exact cause of optic neuritis is unknown. It's believed to develop when the immune system mistakenly targets the substance covering your optic nerve, resulting in inflammation and damage to the myelin. Normally, the myelin helps electrical impulses travel quickly from the eye to the brain, where they're converted into visual information. Optic neuritis disrupts this process, affecting vision. The following autoimmune conditions often are associated with optic neuritis: Multiple sclerosis. Multiple sclerosis is a disease in which your autoimmune system attacks the myelin sheath covering nerve fibers in your brain. In people with optic neuritis, the risk of developing multiple sclerosis after one episode of optic neuritis is about 50% over a lifetime. Your risk of developing multiple sclerosis after optic neuritis increases further if an Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan shows lesions on your brain. Neuromyelitis optica. In this condition, inflammation affects the optic nerve and spinal cord. Neuromyelitis optica has similarities to multiple sclerosis, but neuromyelitis optica doesn't cause damage to the nerves in the brain as often as multiple sclerosis does. Still, neuromyelitis optica is more severe than MS , often resulting in a diminished recovery after an attack compared with MS . Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody disorder. This condition can cause inflammation to the optic nerve, spinal cord or brain. Similar to MS and neuromyelitis optica, recurrent attacks of inflammation can occur. Recovery from myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) attacks is usually better than recovery from neuromyelitis optica. When symptoms of optic neuritis are more complex, other associated causes need to be considered, including: Infections. Bacterial infections, including Lyme disease, cat-scratch fever and syphilis, or viruses, such as measles, mumps and herpes, can cause optic neuritis. Other diseases. Diseases such as sarcoidosis, Behcet's disease and lupus can cause recurrent optic neuritis. Drugs and toxins. Some drugs and toxins have been associated with the development of optic neuritis. Ethambutol, used to treat tuberculosis, and methanol, a common ingredient in antifreeze, paints and solvents, are associated with optic neuritis.",

Orthostatic hypotension signs and symptoms include: Lightheadedness or dizziness upon standing Blurry vision Weakness Fainting (syncope) Confusion",
            "causes": "When standing from a sitting or lying position, gravity causes blood to collect in the legs and belly. Blood pressure drops because there's less blood flowing back to the heart. Usually, special cells (baroreceptors) near the heart and neck arteries sense this lower blood pressure. The baroreceptors send signals to the brain. This tells the heart to beat faster and pump more blood, which evens out blood pressure. These cells also narrow the blood vessels and increase blood pressure. Orthostatic hypotension occurs when something interrupts the body's process of dealing with the low blood pressure. Many conditions can cause orthostatic hypotension, including: Dehydration. Fever, vomiting, not drinking enough fluids, severe diarrhea and strenuous exercise with a lot of sweating can all lead to dehydration. Dehydration decreases blood volume. Mild dehydration can cause symptoms of orthostatic hypotension, such as weakness, dizziness and fatigue. Heart problems. Some heart conditions that can lead to low blood pressure include extremely low heart rate (bradycardia), heart valve problems, heart attack and heart failure. These conditions prevent the body from quickly pumping more blood when standing up. Endocrine problems. Thyroid conditions, adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) and low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) can cause orthostatic hypotension. So can diabetes, which can damage the nerves that help send signals that control blood pressure. Nervous system disorders. Some nervous system disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, Lewy body dementia, pure autonomic failure and amyloidosis, can disrupt the body's ability to control blood pressure.

            "causes": "Osteoarthritis occurs when the cartilage that cushions the ends of bones in your joints gradually deteriorates. Cartilage is a firm, slippery tissue that enables nearly frictionless joint motion. Eventually, if the cartilage wears down completely, bone will rub on bone. Osteoarthritis has often been referred to as a wear and tear disease. But besides the breakdown of cartilage, osteoarthritis affects the entire joint. It causes changes in the bone and deterioration of the connective tissues that hold the joint together and attach muscle to bone. It also causes inflammation of the joint lining.",

Ovarian blood vessels react abnormally to human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) and begin to leak fluid. This fluid swells the ovaries, and sometimes large amounts move into the abdomen. During fertility treatments, HCG may be given as a \"trigger\" so that a mature follicle will release its egg. OHSS usually happens within a week after you receive an HCG injection. If you become pregnant during a treatment cycle, OHSS may worsen as your body begins producing its own HCG in response to the pregnancy. Injectable fertility medications are more likely to cause OHSS than is treatment with clomiphene, a medication given as a pill you take by mouth.

The disease might affect only one or two areas of your body or might be widespread. Your signs and symptoms, if any, will depend on the affected part of your body. Pelvis. Paget's disease of bone in the pelvis can cause hip pain. Skull. An overgrowth of bone in the skull can cause hearing loss or headaches. Spine. If your spine is affected, nerve roots can become compressed. This can cause pain, tingling and numbness in an arm or leg. Leg.

            "causes": "To understand the cause of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), it might help to learn more about how the heart typically beats. The heart is made of four chambers \u2014 two upper chambers (atria) and two lower chambers (ventricles). The heart's rhythm is controlled by a natural pacemaker (the sinus node) in the right upper chamber (atrium). The sinus node sends electrical signals that typically start each heartbeat. These electrical signals move across the atria, causing the heart muscles to squeeze (contract) and pump blood into the ventricles. Next, the signals arrive at a cluster of cells called the atrioventricular (AV) node, where they slow down. This slight delay allows the ventricles to fill with blood. When the electrical signals reach the ventricles, the chambers contract and pump blood to the lungs or to the rest of the body. In a typical heart, this heart signaling process usually goes smoothly, resulting in a resting heart rate of 60 to 100 beats a minute.",

Radiation proctitis can begin during radiation treatment and last for a few months after treatment. Or it can occur years after treatment. Antibiotics. Sometimes antibiotics used to treat an infection can kill helpful bacteria in the bowels, allowing the harmful Clostridium difficile bacteria to grow in the rectum. Diversion proctitis. Proctitis can occur in people following some types of colon surgery in which the passage of stool is diverted from the rectum to a surgically created opening (stoma). Food protein-induced proctitis.

For instance, when a baby cries, the need for comfort, a meal or a diaper change must be met with a shared emotional exchange that may include eye contact, smiling and caressing. A child whose needs are ignored or who is met with a lack of emotional response from caregivers does not come to expect care or comfort or form a stable attachment to caregivers. It's not clear why some babies and children develop reactive attachment disorder and others don't. Various theories about reactive attachment disorder and its causes exist, and more research is needed to develop a better understanding and improve diagnosis and treatment options.",

Most infants with Rett syndrome seem to grow and behave as expected for the first six months. After that, signs and symptoms start to appear. The most pronounced changes generally occur at 12 to 18 months of age, over a period of weeks or months. Symptoms and their severity vary greatly from child to child. The main signs and symptoms include: Slowed growth. Brain growth slows after birth. Smaller than usual head size (microcephaly) is sometimes the first sign that a child has Rett syndrome. As children get older, there is delayed growth in other parts of the body. Loss of movement and coordination abilities. The first signs often include reduced hand control and a decreasing ability to crawl or walk. At first, this loss of abilities occurs rapidly, and then it continues more gradually. Eventually muscles become weak or stiff, with unusual movement and positioning. Loss of communication abilities. Children with Rett syndrome typically begin to lose the ability to speak, to make eye contact and to communicate in other ways. They may become disinterested in other people, toys and their surroundings. Some children have rapid changes, such as a sudden loss of language. Over time, children may gradually regain eye contact and develop nonverbal communication skills. Unusual hand movements. Children with Rett syndrome usually develop repetitive, purposeless hand movements, which differ from child to child. Hand movements may include hand-wringing, squeezing, clapping, tapping or rubbing. Other signs and symptoms can include: Unusual eye movements. Children with Rett syndrome tend to have unusual eye movements, such as intense staring, blinking, crossed eyes or closing one eye at a time. Breathing problems. These include breath holding, rapid breathing (hyperventilation), forcefully blowing out air or saliva, and swallowing air. These problems tend to occur during waking hours. Other breathing disturbances such as shallow breathing or short periods of stopping breathing (apnea) can occur during sleep. Irritability and crying. Children with Rett syndrome may become increasingly agitated and irritable as they get older. Periods of crying or screaming may begin suddenly, for no apparent reason, and last for hours. Some children may experience fears and anxiety. Other unusual behaviors. These may include, for example, sudden, odd facial expressions and long bouts of laughter, hand licking, and grasping of hair or clothing. Intellectual disabilities. Loss of skills may be connected to losing the ability to think, understand and learn. Seizures. Most people who have Rett syndrome experience seizures at some time during their lives. Multiple seizure types may occur and are associated with changes on an electroencephalogram (EEG). Sideways curvature of the spine (scoliosis). Scoliosis is common with Rett syndrome. It typically begins between 8 and 11 years of age and progresses with age. Surgery may be required if the curvature is severe. Irregular heartbeat. This is a life-threatening problem for many children and adults with Rett syndrome and can result in sudden death. Sleep disturbances. Problems with sleep patterns can include irregular sleep times, falling asleep during the day and being awake at night, or waking in the night with crying or screaming. Other symptoms. A variety of other symptoms can occur, such as a decreased response to pain; small hands and feet that are usually cold; problems with chewing and swallowing; problems with bowel function; and teeth grinding.",
            "causes": "Rett syndrome is a rare genetic disorder. Classic Rett syndrome, as well as several variants (atypical Rett syndrome) with milder or more-severe symptoms, occur based on several specific genetic changes (mutations). The genetic changes that cause Rett syndrome occur randomly, usually in the MECP2 gene. Very few cases of this genetic disorder are inherited. The genetic changes appear to result in problems with the protein production critical for brain development. However, the exact cause is not fully understood and is still being studied.",

            "disease": "Secondary hypertension",
            "symptoms": "Like primary hypertension, secondary hypertension usually has no specific symptoms, even if blood pressure has reached dangerously high levels. For people diagnosed with high blood pressure, having any of these signs may mean the condition is secondary hypertension: High blood pressure that doesn't respond to blood pressure medications (resistant hypertension) Very high blood pressure \u2014 systolic blood pressure over 180 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) or diastolic blood pressure over 120 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) High blood pressure that no longer responds to medication that previously controlled the blood pressure Sudden-onset high blood pressure before age 30 or after age 55 No family history of high blood pressure No obesity",
            "causes": "Many health conditions can cause secondary hypertension. Several kidney diseases may cause secondary hypertension, including: Diabetes complications (diabetic nephropathy). Diabetes can damage the kidneys' filtering system, which can lead to high blood pressure. Polycystic kidney disease. In this inherited condition, cysts in the kidneys interfere with kidney function and can raise blood pressure. Glomerular disease. Kidneys remove waste and sodium using tiny filters called glomeruli. In glomerular disease, these filters become swollen. This may raise blood pressure. Renovascular hypertension. This type of high blood pressure is caused by narrowing (stenosis) of one or both arteries leading to the kidneys. Renovascular hypertension is often caused by the same type of fatty plaques that can damage the coronary arteries (atherosclerosis) or a separate condition in which the muscle and fibrous tissues of the renal artery wall thicken and harden into rings (fibromuscular dysplasia). Medical conditions affecting hormone levels also may cause secondary hypertension. These conditions include: Cushing syndrome. In this condition, corticosteroid medications may cause secondary hypertension, or hypertension may be caused by a pituitary tumor or other factors that cause the adrenal glands to produce too much of the hormone cortisol. Aldosteronism. The adrenal glands produce too much of the hormone aldosterone. This makes the kidneys retain salt and water and lose too much potassium, which raises blood pressure. Pheochromocytoma. This rare tumor, usually found in an adrenal gland, produces too much of the hormones adrenaline and noradrenaline. Having this tumor can lead to long-term high blood pressure or short-term spikes in blood pressure. Thyroid problems. When the thyroid gland doesn't produce enough thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism) or produces too much thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism), high blood pressure can result. Hyperparathyroidism. The parathyroid glands control levels of calcium and phosphorus in the body. If the glands release too much parathyroid hormone, the amount of calcium in the blood rises \u2014 which triggers a rise in blood pressure. Other possible causes of secondary hypertension include: Coarctation of the aorta. In this condition, present at birth, the body's main artery (aorta) is narrowed (coarctation). This forces the heart to pump harder to get blood through the aorta and to the rest of the body. As a result, blood pressure increases \u2014 particularly in the arms. Sleep apnea. In this condition, often marked by severe snoring, breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep, causing a lack of oxygen. Not getting enough oxygen may damage the lining of the blood vessel walls, which may make it harder for the blood vessels to control blood pressure. Also, sleep apnea causes part of the nervous system to be overactive and release certain chemicals that increase blood pressure. Obesity. As body weight increases, the amount of blood flowing through the body increases. This increase in blood flow puts added pressure on artery walls, increasing blood pressure. Being overweight also increases the heart rate and makes it harder for the blood vessels to move blood. In addition, fat deposits can release chemicals that raise blood pressure. Pregnancy. Pregnancy can make existing high blood pressure worse or cause high blood pressure to develop (pregnancy-induced hypertension or preeclampsia). Medications and supplements. Various prescription medications \u2014 such as pain relievers, birth control pills, antidepressants and drugs used after organ transplants \u2014 can cause or worsen high blood pressure in some people. Some decongestants and herbal supplements, including ginseng, licorice and ephedra (ma-huang), may have the same effect. Many illegal drugs, such as cocaine and methamphetamine, also increase blood pressure.",

Signs include: High fever Tremor Seizures Irregular heartbeat Unconsciousness",
            "causes": "Excessive accumulation of serotonin in the body creates the symptoms of serotonin syndrome. Typically, nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord produce serotonin that helps regulate attention, behavior and body temperature. Other nerve cells in the body, primarily in the intestines, also produce serotonin. Serotonin plays a role in regulating the digestive process, blood flow and breathing. Although it's possible that taking just one drug that increases serotonin levels can cause serotonin syndrome in some people, this condition occurs most often when people combine certain medications. For example, serotonin syndrome may occur if you take an antidepressant with a migraine medication. It may also occur if you take an antidepressant with an opioid pain medication. Another cause of serotonin syndrome is intentional overdose of antidepressant medications. A number of over-the-counter and prescription drugs may be associated with serotonin syndrome, especially antidepressants. Illicit drugs and dietary supplements also may be associated with the condition. The drugs and supplements that could potentially cause serotonin syndrome include: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), antidepressants such as citalopram (Celexa), fluoxetine (Prozac), fluvoxamine (Luvox), escitalopram (Lexapro), paroxetine (Paxil, Pexeva, Brisdelle) and sertraline (Zoloft) Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), antidepressants such as desvenlafaxine (Pristiq), levomilnacipran (Fetzima), milnacipran (Savella), duloxetine (Cymbalta, Drizalma Sprinkle) and venlafaxine (Effexor XR) Bupropion (Zyban, Wellbutrin SR, Wellbutrin XL), an antidepressant and tobacco-addiction medication Tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline and nortriptyline (Pamelor) Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), antidepressants such as isocarboxazid (Marplan) and phenelzine (Nardil) Anti-migraine medications, such as carbamazepine (Tegretol, Carbatrol, others), valproic acid and triptans, which include almotriptan, naratriptan (Amerge) and sumatriptan (Imitrex, Tosymra, others) Pain medications, such as opioid pain medications including codeine, fentanyl (Duragesic, Abstral, others), hydrocodone (Hysingla ER), meperidine (Demerol), oxycodone (Oxycontin, Roxicodone, others) and tramadol (Ultram, ConZip) Lithium (Lithobid), a mood stabilizer Illicit drugs, including LSD, ecstasy, cocaine and amphetamines Herbal supplements, including St. John's wort, ginseng and nutmeg Over-the-counter cough and cold medications containing dextromethorphan (Delsym) Anti-nausea medications such as granisetron (Sancuso, Sustol), metoclopramide (Reglan), droperidol (Inapsine) and ondansetron (Zofran) Linezolid (Zyvox), an antibiotic Ritonavir (Norvir), an anti-retroviral medication used to treat\u00a0human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).",

For some people, the pain can be intense. Depending on the location of the pain, it can sometimes be mistaken for problems with the heart, lungs or kidneys. Some people experience shingles pain without ever developing the rash. Most commonly, the shingles rash develops as a stripe of blisters that wraps around either the left or right side of the torso. Sometimes the shingles rash occurs around one eye or on one side of the neck or face.",
            "causes": "Shingles is caused by the varicella-zoster virus \u2014 the same virus that causes chickenpox. Anyone who's had chickenpox may develop shingles. After you recover from chickenpox, the virus enters your nervous system and stays inactive for years. Sometimes the virus reactivates and travels along nerve pathways to your skin \u2014 producing shingles. But not everyone who's had chickenpox will develop shingles. The reason for shingles is unclear. It may be due to lowered immunity to infections as people get older. Shingles is more common in older adults and in people who have weakened immune systems. Varicella-zoster is part of a group of viruses called herpes viruses. This is the same group that includes the viruses that cause cold sores and genital herpes. As a result, shingles is also known as herpes zoster. But the virus that causes chickenpox and shingles isn't the same virus that causes cold sores or genital herpes, which is a sexually transmitted infection.",

            "symptoms": "Symptoms of sickle cell anemia usually appear around 6 months of age. They vary from person to person and may change over time.\u00a0Symptoms can include: Anemia. Sickle cells break apart easily and die. Typical red\u00a0blood cells usually live for about 120 days before they need to be replaced. But sickle cells usually die in 10 to 20 days, leaving a shortage of red blood cells. This is known as anemia.\u00a0Without enough red blood cells, the body can't get enough oxygen. This causes fatigue. Episodes of pain. Periodic episodes of extreme pain, called pain crises, are a major symptom of sickle cell anemia. Pain develops when sickle-shaped red blood cells block blood flow through tiny blood vessels to the chest, abdomen and joints. The pain varies in intensity and can last for a few hours to a few days. Some people have only a few pain crises a year. Others have a dozen or more a year. A severe pain crisis requires a hospital stay. Some people with sickle cell anemia also have chronic pain from bone and joint damage, ulcers, and other causes. Swelling of hands and feet. Sickle-shaped red blood cells block blood circulation in the hands and feet, which can cause them to swell. Frequent infections. The spleen is important for protecting against infections. Sickle cells can damage the spleen, raising the risk of developing infections.\u00a0Babies and children with sickle cell anemia commonly receive vaccinations and antibiotics to prevent potentially life-threatening infections, such as pneumonia. Delayed growth or puberty. Red blood cells provide the body with the oxygen and nutrients needed for growth. A shortage of healthy red blood cells can slow growth in babies and children and delay puberty in teenagers. Vision problems. Tiny blood vessels that supply blood to the eyes can become plugged with sickle cells. This can damage the portion of the eye that processes visual images, called the retina, and lead to vision problems.",
            "causes": "Sickle cell anemia is caused by a change in the gene that tells the body to make hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the iron-rich compound in red blood cells that allows these cells to carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. The hemoglobin associated with sickle cell anemia causes red blood cells to become rigid, sticky and misshapen. For a child to have sickle cell anemia, both parents must carry one copy of the sickle cell gene and pass both copies to the child. If only one parent passes the sickle cell gene to the child, that child will have the sickle cell trait. With one typical hemoglobin gene and one sickle cell gene, people with the sickle cell trait make both typical hemoglobin and sickle cell hemoglobin. Their blood might contain some sickle cells, but they generally don't have symptoms.\u00a0They're carriers of the disease. That means they can pass the gene to their children.",

But determining which nodules are cancerous can't be done by evaluating your symptoms alone. Most cancerous thyroid nodules are slow growing and may be small when your doctor discovers them. Aggressive thyroid cancers are rare with nodules that may be large, firm, fixed and rapid growing.",
            "causes": "Several conditions can cause nodules to develop in your thyroid gland, including: Overgrowth of normal thyroid tissue. An overgrowth of normal thyroid tissue is sometimes referred to as a thyroid adenoma. It's unclear why this occurs, but it's not cancerous and isn't considered serious unless it causes bothersome symptoms from its size. Some thyroid adenomas lead to hyperthyroidism. Thyroid cyst. Fluid-filled cavities (cysts) in the thyroid most commonly result from degenerating thyroid adenomas. Often, solid components are mixed with fluid in thyroid cysts. Cysts are usually noncancerous, but they occasionally contain cancerous solid components. Chronic inflammation of the thyroid. Hashimoto's disease, a thyroid disorder, can cause thyroid inflammation and result in enlarged nodules. This often is associated with hypothyroidism. Multinodular goiter. The term goiter is used to describe any enlargement of the thyroid gland, which can be caused by iodine deficiency or a thyroid disorder. A multinodular goiter contains multiple distinct nodules within the goiter, but its cause is less clear. Thyroid cancer. The chances that a nodule is cancerous are small. However, a nodule that is large and hard or causes pain or discomfort is more worrisome. You will likely want to have it checked by your doctor. Certain factors increase your risk of thyroid cancer, such as a family history of thyroid or other endocrine cancers and having a history of radiation exposure from medical therapy or from nuclear fallout. Iodine deficiency. Lack of iodine in your diet can sometimes cause your thyroid gland to develop thyroid nodules. But iodine deficiency is uncommon in the United States, where iodine is routinely added to table salt and other foods.",

Transverse myelitis usually affects both sides of the body below the affected area of the spinal cord, but sometimes there are symptoms on just one side of the body. Typical signs and symptoms include: Pain. Transverse myelitis pain may begin suddenly in your lower back. Sharp pain may shoot down your legs or arms or around your chest or abdomen. Pain symptoms vary based on the part of your spinal cord that's affected. Abnormal sensations. Some people with transverse myelitis report sensations of numbness, tingling, coldness or burning. Some are especially sensitive to the light touch of clothing or to extreme heat or cold. You may feel as if something is tightly wrapping the skin of your chest, abdomen or legs. Weakness in your arms or legs. Some people notice heaviness in the legs, or that they're stumbling or dragging one foot. Others may develop severe weakness or even total paralysis. Bladder and bowel problems. This may include needing to urinate more frequently, urinary incontinence, difficulty urinating and constipation.",
            "causes": "The exact reason for transverse myelitis is not known. Sometimes there is no known cause. Viral, bacterial and fungal infections affecting the spinal cord may cause transverse myelitis. In most cases, the inflammatory disorder appears after recovery from the infection. Viruses associated with transverse myelitis are: Herpes viruses, including the one that causes shingles and chickenpox (zoster) Cytomegalovirus Epstein-Barr HIV Enteroviruses such as poliovirus and coxsackievirus West Nile Echovirus Zika Influenza Hepatitis B Mumps, measles and rubella Other viruses may trigger an autoimmune reaction without directly infecting the spinal cord. Bacterial infections that are associated with transverse myelitis include: Lyme disease Syphilis Tuberculosis Actinomyces Pertussis Tetanus Diphtheria Bacterial skin infections, gastroenteritis and certain types of bacterial pneumonia also may cause transverse myelitis. Rarely, parasites and fungal infections may infect the spinal cord. There are a number of inflammatory conditions that appear to cause the disorder: Multiple sclerosis is a disorder in which the immune system destroys myelin surrounding nerves in your spinal cord and brain. Transverse myelitis can be the first sign of multiple sclerosis or represent a relapse. Transverse myelitis as a sign of multiple sclerosis usually causes symptoms on only one side of your body. Neuromyelitis optica (Devic's disease) is a condition that causes inflammation and myelin loss around the spinal cord and the nerve in your eye that transmits information to your brain. Transverse myelitis associated with neuromyelitis optica usually affects both sides of your body. In addition to transverse myelitis, you may experience symptoms of damage to myelin of the optic nerve, including pain in the eye with movement and temporary vision loss. This can happen with or separately from transverse myelitis symptoms. However, some people with neuromyelitis optica don't experience eye-related problems and might have only recurrent episodes of transverse myelitis. Autoimmune disorders probably contribute to transverse myelitis in some people. These disorders include lupus, which can affect multiple body systems, and Sjogren's syndrome, which causes severe dryness of the mouth and eyes. Transverse myelitis associated with an autoimmune disorder may be a warning sign of neuromyelitis optica. Neuromyelitis optica occurs more frequently in people with other autoimmune diseases. Vaccinations for infectious diseases have occasionally been associated as a possible trigger. However, at this time the association is not strong enough to warrant limiting any vaccine. Sarcoidosis is a condition that leads to inflammation in many areas of the body, including the spinal cord and optic nerve. It may mimic neuromyelitis optica, but typically sarcoidosis symptoms develop more slowly. The cause of sarcoidosis isn't understood.",

Vehicle-related collisions. Collisions involving cars, motorcycles or bicycles \u2014 and pedestrians involved in such accidents \u2014 are a common cause of traumatic brain injury. Violence. Gunshot wounds, domestic violence, child abuse and other assaults are common causes. Shaken baby syndrome is a traumatic brain injury in infants caused by violent shaking. Sports injuries. Traumatic brain injuries may be caused by injuries from a number of sports, including soccer, boxing, football, baseball, lacrosse, skateboarding, hockey, and other high-impact or extreme sports. These are particularly common in youth. Explosive blasts and other combat injuries. Explosive blasts are a common cause of traumatic brain injury in active-duty military personnel. Although how the damage occurs isn't yet well understood, many researchers believe that the pressure wave passing through the brain significantly disrupts brain function.

Some girls and women with triple X syndrome have intelligence in the normal range, but possibly slightly lower when compared with siblings. Others may have intellectual disabilities and sometimes may have behavioral problems. Occasionally, significant symptoms may occur, which vary among individuals. These signs and symptoms may show up as: Delayed development of speech and language skills, as well as motor skills, such as sitting up and walking Learning disabilities, such as difficulty with reading, understanding or math Behavioral problems, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or symptoms of autism spectrum disorder Psychological problems, such as anxiety and depression Problems with fine and gross motor skills, memory, judgment and information processing Sometimes females with triple X syndrome have these signs and symptoms: Vertical folds of skin that cover the inner corners of the eyes (epicanthal folds) Widely spaced eyes Curved pinky fingers Flat feet Breastbone with an inward bowed shape Weak muscle tone (hypotonia) Seizures Problems with the kidneys Ovaries that don't work properly at a young age (premature ovarian failure)",
            "causes": "Although triple X syndrome is genetic, it's usually not inherited \u2014 it's due to a random genetic error. Normally, people have 46 chromosomes in each cell, organized into 23 pairs, including two sex chromosomes. One set of chromosomes is from the mother and the other set is from the father. These chromosomes contain genes, which carry instructions that determine everything from height to eye color. The pair of sex chromosomes \u2014 either XX or XY \u2014 determines a child's sex. A mother can give the child only an X chromosome, but a father can pass on an X or a Y chromosome: If the child receives an X chromosome from the father, the XX pair makes the child genetically female. If the child receives a Y chromosome from the father, the XY pair means the child is genetically male. Females with triple X syndrome have a third X chromosome from a random error in cell division. This error can happen before conception or early in the embryo's development, resulting in one of these forms of triple X syndrome: Nondisjunction. In most cases, either the mother's egg cell or the father's sperm cell divides incorrectly, resulting in an extra X chromosome in the child. This random error is called nondisjunction, and all the cells in the child's body will have the extra X chromosome. Mosaic. Occasionally, the extra chromosome results from an incorrect cell division caused by a random event early in the embryo's development. If this is the case, the child has a mosaic form of triple X syndrome, and only some cells have the extra X chromosome. Females with the mosaic form may have less obvious symptoms. Triple X syndrome is also called 47,XXX syndrome because the extra X chromosome results in 47 chromosomes in each cell instead of the usual 46.",

            "disease": "Tuberculosis",
            "symptoms": "When TB germs survive and multiply in the lungs, it is called a TB infection. A TB infection may be in one of three stages. Symptoms are different in each stage. Primary\u00a0TB\u00a0infection. The first stage is called the primary infection. Immune system cells find and capture the germs. The immune system may completely destroy the germs. But some captured germs may still survive and multiply. Most people don't have symptoms during a primary infection. Some people may get flu-like symptoms, such as: Low fever. Tiredness. Cough. Latent\u00a0TB\u00a0infection. Primary infection is usually followed by the stage called latent\u00a0TB\u00a0infection. Immune system cells build a wall around lung tissue with\u00a0TB\u00a0germs. The germs can't do any more harm if the immune system keeps them under control. But the germs survive. There are no symptoms during latent\u00a0TB\u00a0infection. Active\u00a0TB\u00a0disease. Active\u00a0TB\u00a0disease happens when the immune system can't control an infection. Germs cause disease throughout the lungs or other parts of the body. Active\u00a0TB\u00a0disease may happen right after primary infection. But it usually happens after months or years of latent\u00a0TB\u00a0infection. Symptoms of active\u00a0TB\u00a0disease in the lungs usually begin gradually and worsen over a few weeks. They may include: Cough. Coughing up blood or mucus. Chest pain. Pain with breathing or coughing. Fever. Chills. Night sweats. Weight loss. Not wanting to eat. Tiredness. Not feeling well in general. Active\u00a0TB\u00a0disease outside the lungs. TB\u00a0infection can spread from the lungs to other parts of the body. This is called extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Symptoms vary depending on what part of the body is infected. Common symptoms may include: Fever. Chills. Night sweats. Weight loss. Not wanting to eat. Tiredness. Not feeling well in general. Pain near the site of infection. Active\u00a0TB\u00a0disease in the voice box is outside the lungs, but it has symptoms more like disease in the lungs. Common sites of active\u00a0TB\u00a0disease outside the lungs include: Kidneys. Liver. Fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord. Heart muscles. Genitals. Lymph nodes. Bones and joints. Skin. Walls of blood vessels. Voice box, also called larynx. Active\u00a0TB\u00a0disease in children. Symptoms of active\u00a0TB\u00a0disease in children vary. Typically, symptoms by age may include the following: Teenagers. Symptoms are similar to adult symptoms. 1- to 12-year-olds. Younger children may have a fever that won't go away and weight loss. Infants. The baby doesn't grow or gain weight as expected. Also, a baby may have symptoms from swelling in the fluid around the brain or spinal cord, including: Being sluggish or not active. Unusually fussy. Vomiting. Poor feeding. Bulging soft spot on the head. Poor reflexes.",
            "causes": "Tuberculosis is caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. People with active TB disease in the lungs or voice box can spread the disease. They release tiny droplets that carry the bacteria through the air. This can happen when they're speaking, singing, laughing, coughing or sneezing. A person can get an infection after inhaling the droplets. The disease is more likely to spread when people spend a lot of time together in an indoor space. So the disease spreads easily in places where people live or work together for long periods. Also, the disease spreads more easily in crowded gatherings. A person with a latent TB infection cannot pass the disease to other people. A person taking medicine to treat active TB disease usually can't pass the disease after 2 to 3 weeks of treatment.",

            "causes": "Most people are born with two sex chromosomes. Males inherit the X chromosome from their mothers and the Y chromosome from their fathers. Females inherit one X chromosome from each parent. In females who have Turner syndrome, one copy of the X chromosome is missing, partially missing or changed. The genetic changes of Turner syndrome may be one of the following: Monosomy. The complete absence of an X chromosome generally occurs because of an error in the father's sperm or in the mother's egg. This results in every cell in the body having only one X chromosome. Mosaicism. In some cases, an error occurs in cell division during early stages of fetal development. This results in some cells in the body having two complete copies of the X chromosome. Other cells have only one copy of the X chromosome. X chromosome changes. Changed or missing parts of one of the X chromosomes can occur. Cells have one complete and one altered copy. This error can occur in the sperm or egg with all cells having one complete and one altered copy. Or the error can occur in cell division in early fetal development so that only some cells contain the changed or missing parts of one of the X chromosomes (mosaicism). Y chromosome material. In a small percentage of Turner syndrome cases, some cells have one copy of the X chromosome and other cells have one copy of the X chromosome and some Y chromosome material. These individuals develop biologically as female, but the presence of Y chromosome material increases the risk of developing a type of cancer called gonadoblastoma.",

Without careful hand-washing after going to the bathroom, the bacteria can move from the hands to objects or other people. The bacteria also can spread from a person who carries the bacteria. It can spread on food that isn't cooked, such as raw fruits without a peel. In places where water isn't treated to kill germs, you can pick up the bacteria from that source.

Vascular dementia signs and symptoms include: Confusion Trouble paying attention and concentrating Reduced ability to organize thoughts or actions Decline in ability to analyze a situation, develop an effective plan and communicate that plan to others Slowed thinking Difficulty with organization Difficulty deciding what to do next Problems with memory Restlessness and agitation Unsteady gait Sudden or frequent urge to urinate or inability to control passing urine Depression or apathy Vascular dementia symptoms may be most clear-cut when they occur suddenly following a stroke. When changes in your thinking and reasoning seem clearly linked to a stroke, this condition is sometimes called post-stroke dementia. Sometimes a characteristic pattern of vascular dementia symptoms follows a series of strokes or ministrokes. Changes in your thought processes occur in noticeable steps downward from your previous level of function, unlike the gradual, steady decline that typically occurs in Alzheimer's disease dementia. But vascular dementia can also develop very gradually, just like Alzheimer's disease dementia. What's more, vascular disease and Alzheimer's disease often occur together. Studies show that many people with dementia and evidence of brain vascular disease also have Alzheimer's disease.",
            "causes": "Vascular dementia results from conditions that damage your brain's blood vessels, reducing their ability to supply your brain with the amounts of nutrition and oxygen it needs to perform thought processes effectively. Common conditions that may lead to vascular dementia include: Stroke (infarction) blocking a brain artery. Strokes that block a brain artery usually cause a range of symptoms that may include vascular dementia. But some strokes don't cause any noticeable symptoms. These silent strokes still increase dementia risk. With both silent and apparent strokes, the risk of vascular dementia increases with the number of strokes that occur over time. One type of vascular dementia involving many strokes is called multi-infarct dementia. Brain hemorrhage. Often caused by high blood pressure weakening a blood vessel leading to bleeding into the brain causing damage or from buildup of protein in small blood vessels occurring with aging weakening them over time (cerebral amyloid angiopathy) Narrowed or chronically damaged brain blood vessels. Conditions that narrow or inflict long-term damage on your brain blood vessels also can lead to vascular dementia.

Symptoms usually last just a day or two, but occasionally they may last up to 14 days.

Norovirus infection can sweep through families and communities. It's especially likely to spread among people in confined spaces. In most cases, you pick up the virus from contaminated food or water. But it can also spread between people who are in close contact or who share food. You can also get the virus by touching a surface that's been contaminated with norovirus and then touching your mouth. Rotavirus. Worldwide, this is the most common cause of viral gastroenteritis in children, who are usually infected when they put their fingers or other objects contaminated with the virus into their mouths. It can also spread through contaminated food. The infection is most severe in infants and young children. Adults infected with rotavirus may not have symptoms, but can still spread the illness. This is of particular concern in institutional settings such as nursing homes because adults with the virus unknowingly can pass the virus to others. A vaccine against viral gastroenteritis is available in some countries, including the United States, and appears to be effective in preventing the infection. Some shellfish, especially raw or undercooked oysters, also can make you sick. Contaminated drinking water is a cause of viral diarrhea.

            "causes": "The usual cause of von Willebrand disease is an inherited abnormal gene that controls von Willebrand factor \u2014 a protein that plays a key role in blood clotting. When you have low levels of this protein or it doesn't work as it should, small blood cells called platelets cannot stick together properly nor attach themselves normally to the blood vessel walls when an injury has occurred. This interferes with the clotting process and can sometimes cause uncontrolled bleeding. Many people with von Willebrand disease also have low levels of factor VIII, another protein that helps in clotting. Factor VIII is involved in another inherited clotting disorder called hemophilia. But unlike hemophilia, which mainly affects males, von Willebrand disease affects males and females and is usually milder. Rarely, von Willebrand disease can develop later in life in people who didn't inherit an affected gene from a parent.
